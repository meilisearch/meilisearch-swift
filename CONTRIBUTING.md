## Hacktoberfest

It's [Hacktoberfest month](https://blog.meilisearch.com/contribute-hacktoberfest-2021/)! ü•≥

üöÄ If your PR gets accepted it will count into your participation to Hacktoberfest!

‚úÖ To be accepted it has either to have been merged, approved or tagged with the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.

üßê Don't forget to check the [quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards)! Low-quality PRs might get marked as `spam` or `invalid`, and will not count toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)(PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the MeiliSearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [MeiliSearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-swift/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-swift/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-swift repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-swift repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-swift/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### On a terminal <!-- omit in TOC -->

### Setup <!-- omit in TOC -->

```bash
swift build
```

### Tests and Linter <!-- omit in TOC -->

If you have a running MeiliSearch instance at port `localhost:7700` with the following master key: `masterKey`, you will need to run the following command to test the package:

```bash
swift test
```

If you do not have a MeiliSearch instance with the previous mentioned parameters, you can run the test script that will automatically run a Docker container with MeiliSearch and start the test:

```bash
./Scripts/run-test.sh
```

If you want to run the linter [`swiftlint`](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint):

```bash
swift run swiftlint
```

If you want to fix your linting errors:

```bash
swift run swiftlint --fix
```

### On Xcode <!-- omit in TOC -->

### Setup <!-- omit in TOC -->

To build the project, if it's not already done, click on the play button in the top left corner of Xcode.

### Tests and linter <!-- omit in TOC -->

To launch the tests:
- Go to Product > Test
- Use the shortcut command + U

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in TOC -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in TOC -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in TOC -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-swift/releases/).

### How to Publish the Release <!-- omit in TOC -->

‚ö†Ô∏è Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/guides/integration-release.md).

Make a PR modifying the file [`MeiliSearch.podspec`](/MeiliSearch.podspec) with the right version.

```ruby
  s.version          = 'X.X.X'
```

Once the changes are merged on `main`, you can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-swift/releases).

GitHub Actions will be triggered and push the package to [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/MeiliSearch).
